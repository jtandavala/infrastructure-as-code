# Infrastructure as Code

[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/tandavala-py/infrastructure-as-code/graph/badge.svg?token=S4oO7mljiS)](https://codecov.io/gh/tandavala-py/infrastructure-as-code)

This repository contains the source code for the internal workshop held at [ITGest](https://itgest.ao/) on **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**.

### Tools and Technologies Used:

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime environment for building scalable and efficient applications.
- **Jest**: A powerful testing framework for JavaScript, used to write and run unit and integration tests.
- **Docker & Docker Compose**: Containerization tools to streamline the development, testing, and deployment processes, ensuring consistent environments across teams.
- **Ansible**: A configuration management and automation tool that simplifies the provisioning and management of infrastructure.
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD tool used to automate workflows, testing, and deployment directly from the GitHub repository.
- **Codecov**: A platform for measuring code coverage, integrated to ensure the quality of the code by tracking test coverage statistics.
- **AWS S3**: Amazon Simple Storage Service, used for storing and managing data in the cloud as part of the infrastructure solution.

### Workshop Overview:

The workshop was designed to introduce participants to the concept of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and how it can be applied using modern tools and cloud platforms. By leveraging **Ansible** for provisioning, **Docker** for containerization, and **AWS S3** for cloud storage, participants learned how to automate the setup and management of infrastructure in a repeatable, scalable, and reliable way. Additionally, the session covered best practices for testing, continuous integration, and deployment pipelines using **Jest**, **GitHub Actions**, and **Codecov**.

This repository serves as a learning resource, providing hands-on examples and project files to help participants explore these tools and practices in real-world scenarios.
