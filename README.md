# Infrastructure as Code

[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/tandavala-py/infrastructure-as-code/graph/badge.svg?token=S4oO7mljiS)](https://codecov.io/gh/tandavala-py/infrastructure-as-code)

This repository contains the source code for the internal workshop held at [ITGest](https://itgest.ao/) on **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**.

### Tools and Technologies Used:

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime environment for building scalable and efficient applications.
- **Jest**: A powerful testing framework for JavaScript, used to write and run unit and integration tests.
- **Docker & Docker Compose**: Containerization tools to streamline the development, testing, and deployment processes, ensuring consistent environments across teams.
- **Ansible**: A configuration management and automation tool that simplifies the provisioning and management of infrastructure.
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD tool used to automate workflows, testing, and deployment directly from the GitHub repository.
- **Codecov**: A platform for measuring code coverage, integrated to ensure the quality of the code by tracking test coverage statistics.
- **AWS EC2**: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), a scalable virtual server platform that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud, used for deploying and managing infrastructure.


### Workshop Overview:

The purpose of this workshop was to provide a hands-on introduction to Infrastructure as Code (IaC), showcasing how modern tools and cloud platforms can be combined to automate and manage infrastructure. The session covered the entire lifecycle, from writing and testing code with Node.js and Jest, to containerizing applications with Docker, to automating infrastructure provisioning using Ansible, all while leveraging cloud computing with AWS EC2.

Participants also explored the creation of continuous integration and deployment pipelines using GitHub Actions and how to monitor code quality with Codecov. These technologies enable teams to efficiently manage infrastructure in a repeatable, consistent, and scalable way.

This repository is intended as a learning resource, containing practical examples and configurations that showcase best practices in Infrastructure as Code, continuous delivery, and cloud automation.
